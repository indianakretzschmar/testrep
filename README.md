This is a repository for all of my homework and labs for the semester. It is a convenient place to store all of my work in this class. The subdirectory structure is made up of a homework section with all of the files underneath, and a Labs section right below with all of its files underneath as well. Everything will be be properly named and neatly organized. Working with this repository will help me later in life when I have to work in github.
